# ðŸ“œ ZenML Starter Project Template

What would you need to get a quick understanding of the ZenML framework and
start building your own ML pipelines? The answer is a simple project template
to cover the basics of ZenML: a collection of steps and pipelines, a stack
configuration and, to top it all off, a simple but useful CLI. This is exactly
what the ZenML starter template is all about.

This project template is a good starting point for anyone starting out with
ZenML. It showcases the following fundamental ZenML concepts in a relatable
ML context:

* designing [ZenML pipeline steps](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/pipelines#step)
in general, but also particularly useful for the following applications:
    * data ingestion, data transformation and data train/test splitting
    * model training and evaluation
* using [step parameterization and caching](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/pipelines/parameters-and-caching)
to design flexible and reusable steps
* using [custom data types for your artifacts and writing materializers for them](https://docs.zenml.io/advanced-guide/pipelines/materializers)
* constructing and running a [ZenML pipeline](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/pipelines#pipeline)
* accessing ZenML pipeline run artifacts in [the post-execution phase](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/pipelines/fetching-pipelines),
after a pipeline run has concluded
* best practices for implementing and running reproducible and reliable ML
pipelines with ZenML

In addition to that, the entire project is implemented with the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
library and showcases how to use ZenML with a popular ML framework. It makes
heavy use of the tabular datasets and classification models that scikit-learn
provides, but the concepts and patterns it showcases are applicable to any
other ML framework.
