# ðŸ“œ ZenML Starter Project Template

What would you need to get a quick understanding of the ZenML framework and
start building your own ML pipelines? The answer is a simple project template
to cover the basics of ZenML: a collection of steps and pipelines, a stack
configuration and, to top it all off, a simple but useful CLI. This is exactly
what the ZenML starter template is all about.

This project template is a good starting point for anyone starting out with
ZenML. It showcases the following fundamental ZenML concepts in a relatable
ML context:

* Designing [ZenML pipeline steps](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide#pipelines-and-steps)
in general, but also particularly useful for the following applications:
    * Data ingestion, data transformation and data train/test splitting
    * >odel training and evaluation
* Using [step parameterization and caching](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/cache-previous-executions)
to design flexible and reusable steps
* Using [custom data types for your artifacts and writing materializers for them](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/artifact-management/handle-custom-data-types)
* Constructing and running a [ZenML pipeline](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide#pipelines-and-steps)
* Accessing ZenML pipeline run artifacts in [the post-execution phase](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/fetch-runs-after-execution),
after a pipeline run has concluded
* Best practices for implementing and running reproducible and reliable ML
pipelines with ZenML

In addition to that, the entire project is implemented with the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
library and showcases how to use ZenML with a popular ML framework. It makes
heavy use of the tabular datasets and classification models that scikit-learn
provides, but the concepts and patterns it showcases are applicable to any
other ML framework.

## ðŸš€ Generate the Project

### ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

To use the templates, you need to have Zenml and its `templates` extras
installed: 

```bash
pip install zenml[templates]
```

### ðŸš€ Generate a ZenML Project

You can generate a project byusing the `--template` flag with the `zenml init` command:

```bash
zenml init --template starter
```

Under the hood, ZenML uses the popular [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
library and a set of Jinja2 templates to generate the project. So you may also
interact with Copier directly to generate a project, e.g.:

```bash
copier gh:zenml-io/template-starter <directory>
```

You will be prompted to enter various values for
the template variables. Once you have entered them, the project will be
generated in the indicated path.
