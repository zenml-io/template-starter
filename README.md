# ðŸ“œ ZenML Project Templates

This repository contains a collection of templates from which a ZenML project
can be generated: a collection of steps, pipelines, stack configurations and
other artifacts and useful resources that can get you started with ZenML.

ðŸ”¥ **Do you have a personal project powered by ZenML that you would like to see here ?** At
ZenML, we are looking for design partnerships and collaboration to help us
better understand the real-world scenarios in which MLOps is being used and to
build the best possible experience for our users. If you are interested in
sharing your project with us, please [join our Slack](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/)
and leave us a message!

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

To use the templates, you need to have cookieninja installed, along with the
ansible Jinja2 finter library. You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install cookieninja jinja2-ansible-filters
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

You can generate a project from a template by running e.g.:

```bash
cookieninja gh:zenml-io/zenml-project-templates:starter
```
