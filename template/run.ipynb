    "# Huggingface Model to Sagemaker Endpoint: Automating MLOps with ZenML\n",
    "Deploying Huggingface models to AWS Sagemaker endpoints typically only requires a few lines of code. However, there's a growing demand to not just deploy, but to seamlessly automate the entire flow from training to production with comprehensive lineage tracking. ZenML adeptly fills this niche, providing an end-to-end MLOps solution for Huggingface users wishing to deploy to Sagemaker. Below, we’ll walk through the architecture that ZenML employs to bring a Huggingface model into production with AWS Sagemaker. Of course all of this can be adapted to not just Sagemaker, but any other model deployment service like GCP Vertex or Azure ML Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post showcases one way of using ZenML pipelines to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create and version a dataset in a feature_engineering_pipeline.\n",
    "- Train/Finetune a BERT-based Sentiment Analysis NLP model and push to Huggingface Hub in a training_pipeline.\n",
    "- Promote this model to Production by comparing to previous models in a promotion_pipeline.\n",
    "- Deploy the model at the Production Stage to a AWS Sagemaker endpoint with a deployment_pipeline.\n",

    "ZenML builds upon the straightforward deployment capability of Huggingface models to AWS Sagemaker, and transforms it into a sophisticated, repeatable, and transparent MLOps workflow. It takes charge of the intricate steps necessary for modern ML systems, ensuring that software engineering leads can focus on iteration and innovation rather than operational intricacies.\n",
